                The Fresno Veterans Day Parade honors our veterans from all branches. The parade is held in downtown Fresno. It has grown by leaps and bounds over its nine decades of existence, so much so in fact, that in 2007, the Executive Board of the Parade presented the idea of becoming incorporated and applying for 501(c)3 status. The response was unanimous and the parade became a not-for-profit corporation in California.

                Wikipedia â€“ U.S. President Woodrow Wilson first proclaimed Armistice Day for November 11, 1919. In proclaiming the holiday, he said "To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations."
